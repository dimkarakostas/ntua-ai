Exercise 1
=====================
Simulation of two robots in a room, where the first robot (T) moves with twice the speed of the second (J). Robot T uses the A* algorithm in order to calculate its next move, whereas robot J uses the Manhattan Distance.

Compiling
---------------------
Compile the **robots.cpp** file using a Windows compiler.

Usage
---------------------
Input a file where the first line contains the dimensions of the room, the second and the third line the positions of T and J respectively and the next lines the room, where 0 represents a space and x a wall.
Every time a move is made you need to press Enter in order for the simulation to continue, until T has reached J.
